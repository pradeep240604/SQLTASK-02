## 📌 Overview

This project presents an **Employee Management System** built using **MySQL**. It covers the creation and population
of employee-related database tables and demonstrates key SQL queries and operations such as **data retrieval**, 
**joins**, **aggregate functions**, **conditions**, and more.

This project is ideal for practicing fundamental and intermediate SQL operations with real-world-like employee data.

## 🧱 Database Schema

The project consists of the following tables:

- **Employee:** Stores employee details such as ID, name, salary, and department.
- **Department:** Contains department names and IDs.
- **Bonus:** Tracks bonus allocations to employees.
- **Title:** Maintains job titles and their associations with employees.

## ✅ Features & SQL Concepts Covered

- Table creation with appropriate data types and constraints  
- Data insertion using `INSERT INTO`  
- Data retrieval with `SELECT`  
- Use of `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, and `HAVING` clauses  
- Aggregate functions: `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, `MAX`, `MIN`  
- Use of `JOIN` operations: `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`  
- Subqueries  
- Conditional queries using `CASE`  
- Pattern matching with `LIKE`  
- Use of `DISTINCT` and `LIMIT`
